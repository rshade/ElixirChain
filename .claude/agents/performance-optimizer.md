## ElixirChain-Specific Optimizations

**Conversation Memory Optimization:**
```elixir
# Optimized conversation state with compression
defmodule OptimizedConversationState do
  defstruct [
    :agent_id,
    recent_messages: [],      # Keep last 10 messages in memory
    compressed_history: nil,  # Compressed older messages
    context_summary: nil,     # LLM-generated summary for very old context
    message_count: 0
  ]
  
  def add_message(state, message) when state.message_count > 100 do
    # Implement compression strategy for long conversations
    compress_older_messages(state, message)
  end
end
```

- Implement connection pooling with configurable pool sizes per provider
- Design request batching for multiple agent requests to the same provider
- Create intelligent retry mechanisms with exponential backoff and circuit breakers
